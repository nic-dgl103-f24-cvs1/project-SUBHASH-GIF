# 1. Project Summary

- **Chosen website** - Kehler vegetable company https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/
- **Explanation:-**
   The Website that the client is using now has perfomance and accessibility issues and it doesn't look professional.

    The purpose of the website is to keep the existing coustomers and new coustomers updated about the freshest produce,berries and non-gmo eggs and make the coustomers visit and buy from their farmstand.    
   
   The perfomance and accessibility of this page is too bad.The homepage layout definetly needs to change.

### Farm Fresh Tips

- #### How to Store Your Vegetables
    
    Proper storage ensures that your farm-fresh vegetables stay crisp, flavorful, and nutritious for as long as possible. Here are some tips for common produce:
  
    - #### 1. Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale, Lettuce)

        Storage Method: Remove any wilted leaves and wrap the greens in a damp paper towel. Place them in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container.

        Shelf Life: Store in the fridge crisper for 5–7 days.


    - #### 2. Root Vegetables (Carrots, Radishes, Beets)

        Storage Method: Cut off the green tops (they draw moisture from the roots). Store the roots in a perforated plastic bag in the crisper drawer.

        Shelf Life: Lasts 2–3 weeks in the fridge.


    - #### 3. Tomatoes
 
        Storage Method: Keep tomatoes at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, until they ripen. Avoid refrigerating unless they are overripe, as cold temperatures can affect flavor.

        Shelf Life: 1–2 weeks at room temperature.

    - #### 4. Zucchini and Summer Squash

        Storage Method: Store unwashed in a perforated bag in the fridge crisper. Excess moisture can lead to spoilage, so keep them dry.

        Shelf Life: Stays fresh for 1 week.

    - #### 5. Cucumbers

        Storage Method: Wrap cucumbers in a paper towel to absorb excess moisture and store them in the crisper. Avoid storing near apples or bananas, as they emit ethylene gas, which speeds up ripening.

        Shelf Life: 1 week in the fridge.

    - #### 6. Onions and Garlic

        Storage Method: Store in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area (not the fridge). Keep them separate from potatoes to avoid sprouting.

        Shelf Life: Onions can last 2–3 months, and garlic up to 1 month.

    - #### 7. Potatoes

        Storage Method: Keep in a cool, dark place in a breathable bag or basket. Avoid refrigeration, as cold temperatures turn starches into sugar, affecting flavor.

        Shelf Life: Up to 3 months if stored properly.

    - #### 8. Bell Peppers
        
        Storage Method: Place unwashed in a perforated bag in the fridge. Use within a week for maximum crispness.

        Shelf Life: 5–7 days.

    - #### 9. Herbs (Cilantro, Parsley, Basil)

        Storage Method: Trim the ends, place the herbs in a jar with an inch of water, and cover with a loose plastic bag. Store in the fridge, except for basil, which prefers room temperature.

        Shelf Life: 7–10 days.

    - #### 10. Squash and Pumpkins (Winter Varieties)

        Storage Method: Store whole in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area. Once cut, wrap tightly and refrigerate.

        Shelf Life: Whole squash can last 1–3 months, while cut squash lasts up to 1 week in the fridge.


    - #### 11. Berries and Soft Fruits (Strawberries, Blueberries)

        Storage Method: Keep unwashed in a breathable container lined with paper towels to absorb moisture. Wash just before eating.

        Shelf Life: 3–5 days in the fridge.

    - #### 12. Corn

        Storage Method: Keep the husk on and refrigerate in a plastic bag to maintain sweetness. Use as soon as possible for the best flavor.

        Shelf Life: 2–3 days.

    - #### Bonus Tip:

        For vegetables that start to wilt, soak them in cold water for 20–30 minutes to revive their crispness before cooking.
