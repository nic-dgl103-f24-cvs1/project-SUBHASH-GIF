# 1. Project Summary

- **Chosen website** - Kehler vegetable company https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/
- **Explanation:-**
   The Website that the client is using now has perfomance and accessibility issues and it doesn't look professional.

    The purpose of the website is to keep the existing coustomers and new coustomers updated about the freshest produce,berries and non-gmo eggs and make the coustomers visit and buy from their farmstand.    
   
   The perfomance and accessibility of this page is too bad.The homepage layout definetly needs to change.
